# Example .env file for Jua Smart Solar Advisor
# ========================================
# - Do NOT commit your real `.env` file to source control
# - Keep your API keys private and never share them publicly
# - The `.gitignore` file is configured to prevent accidental commits
# - For deployment, use your platform's secrets management:
#   * Streamlit Cloud: Add to "Advanced settings → Secrets"
#   * Heroku: Use Config Vars
#   * Railway: Use Environment Variables
# - Rotate your API keys if they're ever exposed
